PEP 8 is a style guide for Python code written by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. It outlines coding conventions for writing clean, readable, and consistent Python code. Some of its key recommendations include:

1. **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
2. **Whitespace:** Use spaces rather than tabs. Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
3. **Imports:** Import statements should usually be on separate lines. Import should be grouped in the following order: standard library imports, related third-party imports, and then local application/library-specific imports.
4. **Naming Conventions:** Variables, functions, and methods should follow `lowercase_with_underscores` for names. Constants should be in `ALL_CAPS`.
5. **Comments:** Use inline comments sparingly. Use them to explain complex parts of code or when necessary. Keep them updated as code changes.
6. **Function and Class Names:** Use `lowercase_with_underscores` for function names and `CapWords` for class names.
7. **Whitespace in Expressions and Statements:** Use whitespace around operators and after commas, but avoid extraneous whitespace.
8. **Avoid Extraneous Whitespace:** Don't use more spaces than necessary. For example, avoid trailing whitespace at the end of lines.
9. **Code Layout:** Follow a consistent and readable layout, especially when using multiline constructs.

Following PEP 8 guidelines can improve code consistency and readability, making it easier for other developers to understand and maintain your code. Many Python IDEs and linters have built-in support for enforcing PEP 8 guidelines.

Remember, while PEP 8 is a widely accepted style guide, there might be cases where deviating from it can be acceptable or necessary for specific reasons or in specific projects.
