Jinja2 is a powerful and popular templating engine for Python,
commonly used with web frameworks like Flask and Django. In the context of Flask:

Template Engine: Jinja2 in Flask helps in generating dynamic content by allowing you to embed Python-like code within HTML templates.
 It uses double curly braces {{ }} to render variables and {% %} for control statements like loops and conditions.

Template Inheritance: Jinja2 supports template inheritance, allowing you to create a base template containing the common structure of your web pages and extend or
override specific blocks in individual templates that inherit from it.

Context-Awareness: Jinja2 templates have access to variables passed into them via the Flask routes or functions,
enabling dynamic content generation based on data retrieved from databases, user input, or any other source.
